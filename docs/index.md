# ðŸ”Œ Appliances Energy Forecasting

This project forecasts energy usage using the Appliances Energy Prediction dataset. It implements:

- Classical ARIMA
- Autoregressive RNN
- Probabilistic LSTM-VAE with uncertainty estimation

Forecasts are made for 100 future time steps using multivariate inputs (26 features).

## Key Features

- Probabilistic forecasting
- Direct vs autoregressive strategies
- Evaluation with MAE, RMSE, RÂ², and CRPS
